# Frontend Guideline Document: Gym Admin Dashboard

This document outlines the frontend architecture, design principles, styling, component structure, state management, routing, performance techniques, testing strategy, and security considerations for the Gym Admin Dashboard. It’s written in everyday language so anyone—technical or non-technical—can understand how the frontend is set up.

## 1. Frontend Architecture

### Frameworks and Libraries
- **Next.js (App Router)**: Provides the foundation for pages, layouts, and server-side rendering. It handles routing through a file-system structure and supports both server and client components.  
- **React & TypeScript**: Enables building UI components with static typing to catch errors early.  
- **shadcn/ui**: A set of headless, customizable React components (buttons, cards, tables, dialogs) for building consistent UIs quickly.  
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling without leaving HTML/JSX.  
- **next-themes**: Manages light/dark mode toggling at runtime.  
- **Lucide React**: A library of customizable SVG icons.  
- **Better Auth**: Provides a secure sign-up and sign-in flow, protecting the dashboard behind authentication.  
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerizes the app and database for consistent development environments.  

### Scalability, Maintainability, Performance
- **Modular Structure**: Code lives in logical folders (`app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `db/`), making it easy to add new features like membership or POS modules.  
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript plus Drizzle ORM’s generated types prevent mismatches between UI code and database schemas.  
- **Server Components**: Fetch data on the server for faster initial loads and leaner client bundles.  
- **Utility-First CSS**: Tailwind’s purge feature removes unused styles, keeping CSS files small.  
- **Containerization**: Docker ensures every developer or CI environment runs the same versions, reducing “it works on my machine” issues.

## 2. Design Principles

### Key Principles
- **Usability**: Interfaces are designed to be intuitive. Labels, buttons, and forms follow a consistent pattern so staff can learn one interface and apply it everywhere.  
- **Accessibility**: Components support keyboard navigation and appropriate ARIA attributes, ensuring screen-reader compatibility and compliance with WCAG.  
- **Responsiveness**: Layouts use flexible grids and the responsive features of Tailwind to adapt to different screen sizes—from tablets at the front desk to desktop monitors in the office.  
- **Consistency**: Reusable components and a shared style guide ensure that forms, tables, and dialogs always look and behave the same.  

### Applying Principles to UI
- **Sidebar Navigation**: A collapsible, responsive sidebar keeps navigation within reach without overwhelming small screens.  
- **Form Feedback**: Inline validation messages and disabled submit buttons until forms are valid help prevent mistakes.  
- **Dark Mode**: Low-contrast backgrounds in dark mode reduce eye strain in dim environments while keeping text legible.

## 3. Styling and Theming

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utility classes (e.g., `p-4`, `text-gray-800`) are used directly in JSX for rapid prototyping.  
- **No Additional Pre-processor**: Tailwind handles any nested or custom styles via its configuration.  

### Theming
- **next-themes**: Wraps the app in a theme provider, allowing users to toggle light/dark modes.  
- **Tailwind Configuration**: Custom `tailwind.config.js` defines theme variants and extends color palettes for consistent theming.  

### Visual Style
- **Style**: Clean, flat, modern design—minimal shadows, smooth shapes, and clear typography.  
- **Glassmorphism Accents**: Semi-transparent card backgrounds in dark mode for a subtle glass effect.  

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: #1E3A8A (Deep Indigo)  
- **Secondary**: #10B981 (Emerald Green)  
- **Accent**: #FBBF24 (Amber)  
- **Neutral Light**: #F9FAFB  
- **Neutral Dark**: #1F2937  
- **Error**: #EF4444 (Red)  
- **Success**: #22C55E (Green)  

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter, sans-serif  
- **Base Sizes**: 16px (body), 20px (headers), scaling via Tailwind’s `text-base`, `text-lg`, `text-2xl` utilities.

## 4. Component Structure

### Organization
- **`app/` Directory**: Contains page folders (e.g., `dashboard/`, `api/`) and shared layouts (`layout.tsx`).  
- **`components/ui/`**: Houses low-level, reusable UI primitives from shadcn/ui (Button, Input, Card, Table).  
- **`components/`**: Contains higher-level components (Sidebar, MemberCard, ProductForm) that compose primitives for specific features.  
- **`lib/`**: Utility functions and hooks (e.g., `useAuth`, API clients).  

### Reusability and Maintainability
- **Atomic Design**: Build small primitives first, then compose them into molecules (forms), organisms (tables with filters), and pages.  
- **DRY Principle**: Share common patterns (buttons, modals) in `components/ui` so they can be updated in one place.

## 5. State Management

### Approach
- **Server vs. Client Components**: Most data fetches occur in server components; client components handle interactive UI and local state.  
- **Context API**: Minimal global state (e.g., theme, authentication status) is managed via React Context.  
- **Local State Hooks**: `useState` and `useReducer` for forms, carts, filters.  
- **Forms**: We recommend `react-hook-form` combined with `zod` for schema-based validation, ensuring form data is type-safe and validated before submission.

### Sharing State
- **Auth Context**: Provides user info and tokens to any component that needs to know if the user is logged in and what their role is.  
- **Cart Context (POS)**: Manages selected products before checkout, making it easy for multiple components (list, cart summary, payment form) to stay in sync.

## 6. Routing and Navigation

### File-Based Routing
- **Next.js App Router**: Each folder under `app/` becomes a route. Nested `layout.tsx` files define shared layouts (e.g., sidebar + header).  
- **API Routes**: Located under `app/api/`, file names map to endpoints (e.g., `app/api/check-in/route.ts`).

### Navigation Structure
- **Sidebar**: Contains links to core sections: Dashboard, Members, Products, POS, Reports.  
- **Breadcrumbs**: Optional breadcrumb component helps users know where they are in nested pages.  
- **Link Component**: Uses Next.js’s `<Link>` for prefetching and fast client transitions.

## 7. Performance Optimization

- **Server Components**: Fetch data on the server to reduce client bundle size.  
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**: Use dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`) for heavy components (charts, QR scanners) so they only load when needed.  
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js’s `<Image>` component automatically serves optimized formats (WebP).  
- **CSS Purge**: Tailwind removes unused classes in production, keeping CSS files lean.  
- **Caching & ISR**: Implement Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for analytics pages that update periodically.  
- **Bundle Analysis**: Regularly use `next build --profile` or Webpack Bundle Analyzer to spot large dependencies.

## 8. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategies
- **Unit Tests**: Use Jest and React Testing Library for component logic and rendering.  
- **Integration Tests**: Test API routes and database interactions with a test database or a mocked Drizzle ORM layer.  
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Use Playwright or Cypress to simulate user flows—sign-in, member check-in, POS checkout.  

### Tools and Coverage
- **Jest**: Fast unit and integration tests, with coverage reports.  
- **React Testing Library**: Encourages testing user interactions rather than implementation details.  
- **Cypress/Playwright**: Browser-based tests for critical paths.  
- **Linting & Formatting**: ESLint with TypeScript rules and Prettier enforce code style.  
- **Continuous Integration**: Run tests and lint checks on each pull request to catch regressions early.

## 9. Security and Access Control

### Authentication & Roles
- **Better Auth**: Secures sign-in/up flows.  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Extend user schema with `role` (admin, staff). Middleware checks roles before serving API routes or pages.  

### Validation and Error Handling
- **Zod Schemas**: Validate all incoming API payloads to prevent invalid data.  
- **Standardized Error Responses**: API returns consistent error objects (`{ code, message }`) so the UI can display user-friendly messages.  
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects endpoints like authentication and check-in from abuse.
