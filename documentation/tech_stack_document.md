# Tech Stack Document for Gym Admin Dashboard

This document explains the technology choices behind the Gym Admin Dashboard in everyday language. It describes how each tool or library helps build a reliable, user-friendly gym management system.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

These are the tools we use to build everything you see and interact with in your browser:

- **Next.js (App Router)**
  • Provides the page structure and routing for the dashboard.  
  • Lets us mix server-side and client-side code for faster load times and real-time updates.

- **TypeScript**
  • Adds simple type checking to JavaScript.  
  • Helps catch mistakes early, especially when working with sensitive data like membership details or payments.

- **shadcn/ui**
  • A collection of ready-to-customize components (buttons, tables, forms, cards).  
  • Speeds up building a consistent, professional-looking interface.

- **Tailwind CSS v4**
  • A utility-first styling toolkit that makes it quick to design and adjust layouts.  
  • Supports dark mode and responsive design out of the box.

- **next-themes**
  • Manages light and dark mode switching automatically.  
  • Improves readability for staff working at different times of day.

- **Lucide React**
  • A modern icon set for buttons, menus, and status indicators.  
  • Keeps the interface visually clear and consistent.

- **Charting Library (Recharts or Tremor)**
  • Renders interactive graphs and charts on the main dashboard.  
  • Makes it easy to spot trends in attendance, revenue, and membership activity.

- **QR Code Libraries**
  • `qrcode.react` to generate unique codes for each member.  
  • `react-qr-reader` (or similar) to scan codes at check-in.  
  • Streamlines attendance tracking with a simple scan or manual entry.

- **Form Handling & Validation**
  • `react-hook-form` to manage form state and performance.  
  • `zod` for clear, consistent input validation rules (e.g., ensuring prices are positive numbers).

## 2. Backend Technologies

These components power the data processing, storage, and server-side logic:

- **Better Auth**
  • Handles secure sign-up, sign-in, and password flows.  
  • Provides a foundation for staff and admin user roles with role-based access control.

- **Next.js API Routes**
  • Built-in endpoints for creating custom server logic (membership CRUD, check-in, POS transactions).  
  • Keeps frontend and backend code together for easier maintenance.

- **PostgreSQL**
  • A reliable, relational database for structured data (members, plans, products, logs, transactions).  
  • Well-suited for complex queries and joins (e.g., checking membership status).

- **Drizzle ORM**
  • A type-safe layer on top of PostgreSQL.  
  • Ensures data integrity by catching errors in queries before they reach the database.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

These choices make development, testing, and deployment smooth and reliable:

- **Docker & Docker Compose**
  • Containerize the application and database for consistent local setup.  
  • One command brings up the entire environment—no more "it works on my machine" issues.

- **Version Control (Git + GitHub)**
  • Tracks all code changes and enables team collaboration.  
  • Facilitates code reviews and rollbacks if needed.

- **CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions)**
  • Automates tests, builds, and deployments whenever code is pushed.  
  • Ensures fast feedback and consistent releases.

- **Vercel**
  • A cloud hosting platform optimized for Next.js.  
  • Offers simple, scalable deployments and automatic SSL setup.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

We leverage external services to add functionality without building from scratch:

- **Better Auth** (Authentication)
  • Manages secure user login and sign-up flows.

- **Charting Service** (Recharts or Tremor)
  • Visualizes data on the dashboard (revenue, attendance trends).

- **Sentry** (Error Monitoring)
  • Captures and reports runtime errors in production.  
  • Helps identify and fix issues before they affect staff workflows.

- **Optional Analytics** (e.g., Google Analytics)
  • Tracks overall usage patterns, pageviews, and session durations.  
  • Supports data-driven improvements to the interface.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

We’ve put in safeguards and optimizations to keep data safe and the app snappy:

- **Authentication & RBAC**
  • Better Auth plus custom roles (admin, staff).  
  • Middleware protects sensitive routes (only admins access financial reports).

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**
  • `zod` ensures clean, valid data for all forms and API endpoints.  
  • Prevents bad or malicious data from reaching the database.

- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**
  • Limits repeated requests on login or check-in endpoints.  
  • Guards against brute-force and abuse.

- **Performance Optimization**
  • Next.js server components reduce client-side bundle sizes.  
  • Tailwind CSS tree-shaking includes only the styles you use.

- **Monitoring & Logging**
  • Sentry captures errors and performance bottlenecks.  
  • Enables proactive maintenance and quick issue resolution.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

We’ve chosen a modern, cohesive set of technologies that align perfectly with the goals of a gym management system:

- **Next.js + TypeScript** for a fast, reliable, and maintainable codebase.
- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS + next-themes** for a polished, responsive interface with dark mode support.
- **Better Auth** and **RBAC** for robust, secure user access.
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM** for safe, structured data management.
- **Docker + Vercel + CI/CD** for smooth development and scalable deployment.

Together, these technologies ensure that gym staff can manage memberships, track attendance, process sales, and view analytics in a secure, user-friendly environment. This stack not only accelerates development but also provides a rock-solid foundation for future growth and new features.
